# Password Generator

## Description

The password generator is an application that an employee can use to generate a random password, based on criteria they’ve selected. 

The application is required to:
* Generate a password when the button is clicked
* Present a series of prompts for password criteria, such as the length of password and character types.
* Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected.
* Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page.
