# Password Generator

## Description

The password generator is an application that an employee can use to generate a random password, based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected. 

The application is required to:
* Generate a password when the button is clicked
* Present a series of prompts for password criteria, such as the length of password and character types.
* Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected.
* Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page.

The application can be viewed at https://sophieldavis.github.io/Password_generator/.

## Issues

The application currently has the following issues:
* The application does not always select the right character types selected by the user.
* The application does not always return the right password length.
* The application sometimes fails to return any password at all, and does nothing when the prompts are answered by the user.
